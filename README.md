# Flutter-Watchlist
Tried to create a Watchlist using Flutter in grid view using TDA API.

Sort of had to create my own API, fetching data from TDA API, which is in python. Took the parts I require, then hosted it on AWS (Amazon Web Services). Fetched it in flutter using HTTP get requests. Some weird error where the first try doesn't work but afterwards works perfectly fine. Probably need async await function but can't seem to figure out the implementation/placement as constantly met with errors.
