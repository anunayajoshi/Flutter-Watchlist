# Flutter-Watchlist

Worked on creating a Watchlist using Flutter, integrating with TDAmeritrade API to get market data. 

Had to create my own API, fetching data from TDA API, which is in python. Took the data I require and hosted it on AWS (Amazon Web Services). Fetched it in flutter using HTTP get requests.  

Stopped working on project due to regional authentications problems with TDAmeritrade API, not able to obtain real-time data through the API in Singapore.
